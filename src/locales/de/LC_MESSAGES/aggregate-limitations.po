"If Aggregate is :doc:`installed on Google App Engine <aggregate-app-"

"a combination of request time limits and datastore implementation create "

msgid "Simultaneous push requests will block each other and may time out"
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/aggregate-limitations.rst:27
msgid ""
"Within ODK Aggregate, there is a global mutex (*TaskLock* across all "
"server instances, mediated by the datastore layer) in the server when "
"inserting submissions. Having multiple push requests occurring "
"simultaneously will cause them to block on the mutex, chewing up their "
"60-second request limit, as they get processed in single file no matter "
"how many server instances are spun up."

msgid "Time limit may be exceeded on low-bandwitch connections"
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/aggregate-limitations.rst:34
msgid ""
"The 60-second request limit can be very commonly exceeded over low-"
"bandwidth connections, and even text-only submissions can be impacted on "
"satellite connections. That is why ODK Collect splits submissions into "
"multiple 10MB submission requests. The timer starts upon receipt of the "
"first byte, so a slow connection can account for a sizeable portion of "
"those 60 seconds. The same applies for sending a response. The processing"
" on the server is generally negligible in relation to the transmission "
"times."

"The above two limitations, the global mutex and the in-memory copies"
"/full-packet-assembly, are a result of implementing on top of AppEngine "

"twice. For forms with a lot of media files, this can consume a lot of "
"memory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/aggregate-limitations.rst:46
msgid ""
"The previous section already suggested serializing form submission "
"uploads. This is not absolutely critical for form downlaods, but you "
"should probably manage how many form download requests are being handled "

"Aggregate 1.4.15 fixed the ODK 2.0 rev 210 sync protocol. Prior to this, "
"user permissions were incorrectly being computed and filtered. This "
