"A 6000 hour study in Mumbai that ran from 01 September 2011 through 29 "

" in mind that you can enable billing on an as-needed weekly basis. You will "
"incur no charges at all if you disable billing (for example, between data "

"To minimize App Engine usage fees, users should restrict access to the ODK "
"Aggregate website and **not keep browser windows open on the submissions "
"tab**. That tab is refreshed every 6 seconds if the user is actively doing "
"work, or slightly less frequently if they are not. At the default display of"
" 100 submissions (a minimum of 100 Reads), that can quickly add up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/aggregate-deployment-planning.rst:121
msgid ""
"Keep in mind that every select-one or select-multiple question incurs an "

"each repeat group also costs a Read for each filled-in repeat in that group."

msgid ""
"For example, if your survey has 500 questions, with a repeat group "
"containing an additional 300 questions, and the typical survey has 4 filled-"
"in repeats, then the cost to display the Submissions tab is a minimum of "
"100*( (500 questions in chunks of 200 per Read = 3) + 4*(300 questions in "
"chunks of 200 per Read = 2) ) = 100 * (3 + 4*2) ) = 100 * 11 = 1100 Reads "
"with each refresh of the Submissions tab. At this rate, the free quota would"
" be exceeded within 5 minutes! And this hypothetical survey did not contain "
"any select-one or select-multiple questions, or any audio, video or image "
"captures, all of which would require more Reads."

"Also, it is generally more efficient to use ODK Briefcase to generate CSV "

msgid "ODK Aggregate retains the full dataset."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/aggregate-deployment-planning.rst:131
msgid ""
"In this mode, it is slightly more efficient to Pull data to your local "
"computer then immediately Push it back up. This sets some internal tracking "
"logic within ODK Briefcase so that the next Pull is somewhat more efficient "
"(the Push just verifies that what you have locally matches the content on "
"ODK Aggregate)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/aggregate-deployment-planning.rst:133
msgid "ODK Aggregate retains only a portion of the dataset."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/aggregate-deployment-planning.rst:135
msgid ""
"In this mode, the user periodically uses the Purge button on the Forms "
"Management / Submissions Admin tab to remove older data collection records. "
"In this mode, you would never Push data up to ODK Aggregate, as that would "
"restore the purged data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/aggregate-deployment-planning.rst:137
msgid ""
"Finally, to minimizing usage, set up a data publishing to another "
"application (for example, Fusion Tables) and do your data analysis and "
"review there. You can export CSVs from that platform, should you wish to "
"avoid using ODK Briefcase."
